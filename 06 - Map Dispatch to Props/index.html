    <!-- Map Dispatch to Props

The mapDispatchToProps() function is used to provide specific action creators to your React components so they can dispatch actions against the Redux store. It's similar in structure to the mapStateToProps() function you wrote in the last challenge. It returns an object that maps dispatch actions to property names, which become component props. However, instead of returning a piece of state, each property returns a function that calls dispatch with an action creator and any relevant action data. You have access to this dispatch because it's passed in to mapDispatchToProps() as a parameter when you define the function, just like you passed state to mapStateToProps(). Behind the scenes, React Redux is using Redux's store.dispatch() to conduct these dispatches with mapDispatchToProps(). This is similar to how it uses store.subscribe() for components that are mapped to state.

For example, you have a loginUser() action creator that takes a username as an action payload. The object returned from mapDispatchToProps() for this action creator would look something like:

{
  submitLoginUser: function(username) {
    dispatch(loginUser(username));
  }
}

The code editor provides an action creator called addMessage(). Write the function mapDispatchToProps() that takes dispatch as an argument, then returns an object. The object should have a property submitNewMessage set to the dispatch function, which takes a parameter for the new message to add when it dispatches addMessage(). -->
